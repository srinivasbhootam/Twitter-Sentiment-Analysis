# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Data Wrangling, EDA & Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** using a dataset containing tweets and their sentiment labels. The key steps include **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering** to prepare the data for modeling.

## Dataset Details

- **Source:** Kaggle (Sentiment140 dataset)
- **Data Type:** Text-based (Tweets with sentiment labels)
- **Primary Goal:** Analyze and prepare the dataset for sentiment classification

## Steps Completed

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values or inconsistencies.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
- Removed special characters, URLs, mentions (@user), and unnecessary spaces.
- Converted text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Removed stopwords to retain meaningful words.
- Applied **stemming** or **lemmatization** to reduce words to their base forms.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Word Cloud:** Visualized the most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.
- **N-gram Analysis:** Identified common word pairs and triplets to understand tweet structures.
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Plotted the count of positive vs. negative tweets.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converted text into numerical representations to use in machine learning models.
- Generated a TF-IDF matrix with **5000 features** to capture important words in tweets.
- Ensured balanced feature selection to maintain model interpretability.

## Key Insights

- Common words in **positive** tweets include "love," "great," and "happy."
- **Negative** tweets often contain words like "bad," "worst," and "sad."
- TF-IDF successfully transformed the text data into a format ready for classification models.

## Future Analysis

- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.) on the prepared dataset.
- Optimize features by tuning the vectorizer or trying embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the provided **Jupyter Notebook** to explore the dataset and preprocessing steps.
3. Modify or extend feature engineering techniques as needed.
