# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Data Wrangling, EDA & Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** using a dataset containing tweets and their sentiment labels. The key steps include **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering** to prepare the data for modeling.

## Dataset Details

- **Source:** Kaggle (Sentiment140 dataset)
- **Data Type:** Text-based (Tweets with sentiment labels)
- **Primary Goal:** Analyze and prepare the dataset for sentiment classification

## Steps Completed

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
- Removed special characters, URLs, mentions (@user), and unnecessary spaces.
- Converted text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Removed stopwords to retain meaningful words.
- Applied **stemming** to reduce words to their base forms.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Word Cloud:** Visualized the most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.
- **N-gram Analysis:** Identified common word pairs and triplets to understand tweet structures.
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Plotted the count of positive vs. negative tweets.

### 3. Features for Modeling
- TF-IDF Features: Converts text into numerical values based on word importance, improving model performance.
- Sentiment Score (if applicable): Helps in understanding positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
- Word Count & Character Count: Useful for detecting review length patterns.
- N-grams: Captures context by considering word sequences.

## Key Insights

- Common words in **positive** tweets include "love," "great," and "happy."
- **Negative** tweets often contain words like "bad," "worst," and "sad."
- TF-IDF successfully transformed the text data into a format ready for classification models.

## Future Analysis

- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.) on the prepared dataset.
- Optimize features by tuning the vectorizer or trying embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the provided **Jupyter Notebook** to explore the dataset and preprocessing steps.
3. Modify or extend feature engineering techniques as needed.

## Conclusion

This project successfully preprocesses and explores Twitter data, transforming text into meaningful features for machine learning models. The next step involves implementing classifiers for sentiment prediction.
